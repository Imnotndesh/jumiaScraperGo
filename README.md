- Yes another web scraper that scrapes everyones favourite website: JumiaKE but this time in golang
# What's working and what's not
- [x] Fetching data from jumiaKE
- [ ] Setting data into a usable format e.g JSON or CSV
- [ ] Environmental args for getting specific items
- [ ] Code optimizations to make it faster than it is
